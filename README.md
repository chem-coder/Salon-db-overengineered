# Salon-db-overengineered
FCC Salon project with additional features:

The FCC version asks immediately "what service so ou want to schedule?" 

My version:
1. Has a Startup Menu - what would you like to do? - with options: schedule appt / cancel appt / see pricelist / leave
2. Has additional data tables: multiple stylists offering multiple services, each at their own prices.
3. Gives 2 options for scheduling: 1) a service, or 2) with a stylist
4. Makes it possible to view all client's appointments and cancel appointments.
